# Habit-Helper

Our team of 3 built a prototype of a wireless, wearable device which aids the user in correcting poor posture and low physical activity. Accelerometer data were collected and processed by an Arduino Nano microcontroller to calculate statistics and provide helpful reminders to the user that were sent wirelessly (Bluetooth) to our smartphone application. Our smartphone application shows users' health results and notify them of their condition with regards to posture and physical activity.
